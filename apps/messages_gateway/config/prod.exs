use Mix.Config

# For production, we often load configuration from external
# sources, such as your system environment. For this reason,
# you won't find the :http configuration below, but set inside
# MessagesGatewayWeb.Endpoint.init/2 when load_from_system_env is
# true. Any dynamic configuration should be done there.
#
# Don't forget to configure the url host to something meaningful,
# Phoenix uses this information when generating URLs.
#
# Finally, we also include the path to a cache manifest
# containing the digested version of static files. This
# manifest is generated by the mix phx.digest task
# which you typically run after static files are built.
